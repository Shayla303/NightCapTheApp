This project is a tribute to a an idea I had with my Aunt Pam, to create a food truck specializing in soul food classics available to the daring and hungry after 8pm. On a trip to Chicago Pam went to a brick and mortar location around 3am with a full on soul food buffet line, complete with staff, cafeteria trays, and classic funk blaring in the background. She talked of this experience often as we don't have anything like that in Denver, and frankly through our travels have never experienced such a thing. NightCap is the eventual hope to bring this type of connecting experience to our hometown of Denver.
