This project is a tribute to a an idea I had with my Aunt Pam, to create a food truck specializing in soul food classics available to the daring and hungry after 8pm. On a trip to Chicago, Pam went to a brick and mortar location around 3am with a complete soul food buffet line, complete with staff, cafeteria trays, and sweet tea that flowed like lava. While classic funk and R&B played in the background she and many other after hour clubbers converged on this late night treasure to get full and soak up the alcohol. Pam talks of this experience often as we don't have anything like that in Denver, and frankly through our travels have never experienced such a thing again. NightCap is the eventual hope to bring this type of connecting experience to our hometown of Denver.
